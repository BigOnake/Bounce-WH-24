## Inspiration
Our game is inspired by <em>Lethal League</em> for its high-octane projectile gameplay and <em>Quake</em> for its first-person deathmatch gameplay.
## What it does
Our game is a first-person 1v1 deathmatch game where you can launch a ball around an arena. The ball will continue to gain speed each time it is hit by players. If it hits a player, they die. Whoever runs out of lives first loses. 
## How we built it
We built the game using Unity. We used C# scripts to handle things like physics, movement, mechanics, and many other features. We also focused on a modular design to allow us the ability to add new features easily and increase scalability. Every mechanic was made from scratch.
## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into were:
<ul>
  <li>Getting player movement to feel good and work without problems.</li>
  <li>Managing multiple concurrent players with an ID system.</li>
  <li>Handling user inputs alongside the dynamic splitscreen.</li>
</ul>
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
<ul>
  <li>Implementing scalable modular logic.</li>
  <li>Accomplishing all our submission goals for the game before the deadline.</li>
  <li>We made a compelling, exciting, and fun gameplay loop.</li>
</ul>
## What we learned
<ul>
  <li>How to implement an event and ID system.</li>
  <li>Improved skill in developing 3d games.</li>
  <li>Use of splitscreen and multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
